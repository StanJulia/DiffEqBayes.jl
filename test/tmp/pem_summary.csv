# Inference for Stan model: pem_model
# 1 chains: each with iter=(2000); warmup=(0); thin=(1); 2000 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (1.5) seconds, 1.5 seconds total
# Sampling took (2.8) seconds, 2.8 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
