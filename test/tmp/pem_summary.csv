# Inference for Stan model: pem_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(2000,2000,2000,2000); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1,1); 8000 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (3.9, 3.7, 3.8, 3.3) seconds, 15 seconds total
# Sampling took (7.8, 7.8, 8.6, 7.8) seconds, 32 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
