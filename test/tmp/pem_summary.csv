# Inference for Stan model: pem_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(2000,2000,2000,2000); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1,1); 8000 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (5.7, 4.9, 5.6, 4.8) seconds, 21 seconds total
# Sampling took (12, 13, 11, 9.6) seconds, 44 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
